# BookStore
 The Bookstore is a website similar to the ["Awesome Books"](https://github.com/Miliyonayalew/Awesome-Book-Es6) previous website. I created an MVP version of it that allows to:
- Add a book
- Display a list of books
- Remove a selected book

## Built With
- React
- HTML5
- Linters
- GitFlow
- Redux
  
## Website Mockup üì± üíª üñ•Ô∏è
